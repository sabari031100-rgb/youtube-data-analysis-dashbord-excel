Excel Project: YouTube Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on building an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze YouTube channel performance. The dataset was cleaned and organized to remove inconsistencies, after which pivot tables were used to summarize key metrics. Different types of charts were applied to visualize insights such as monthly trends, audience engagement, and video growth patterns.

The final dashboard highlights important KPIs including views, likes, comments, and subscribers, making it easier to compare performance across videos. By tracking these metrics over time, the dashboard provides actionable insights into audience behavior and helps identify the type of content that drives the most engagement.

This project demonstrates practical use of Excel for data analysis, reporting, and decision-making, showing how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights through visualization and structured analysis.
